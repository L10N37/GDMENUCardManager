### GDI Shrinking
Can reduce the size of the game but some games won't work propperly.

The program have a blacklist with some games known to have problems after shrinking.

By default the blacklist will be used and those games will not be shrinked.

### Limitations
Only works with GDI and CDI formats.

**Don't use it if you have games in CCD, MDS, etc.**
